# Here we seen an analysis of MS Dhoni's chasing efforts on high pressure chases in ODIs

 ##### Below list of matches plots MS Dhoni's SR in final 10 overs against his peers in the same game.
 ##### Here we see in the games listed, MS Dhoni's chase tactic change from being a swashbuckling finished to taking a cautious (sometime overcautious) approach.
 ##### We have used ```MSDhoniMatchbyMatch.py``` python script to analyse Dhoni's chase approach in games where India needed over 6 runs per over at the 40th over withj MS Dhoni on crease. We have considered only the game India has won chasing to analyse MS Dhoni's impact at Chase.

 Alternatively, ```MSDhoniMatchbyMatch.py``` script can be changed to analyze MS Dhoni's approach on high pressure unsuccessful chase as well
 
 **We have made use of ```MS_Dhoni.csv``` file generated via ```PlayerScraper.py``` script for this analysis**

 We can see that as Required Run Rate dips up slightly around 43rd and 44th over which also co-incides with MS Dhoni's rapid increase in Strike rate finishing strong at the 48th over mark.
Other player here in Mohammad Kaif provides a steady support at the other end while MS Dhoni finished game off quickly.

We can see that while Required Run Rate started over 6 at the 40th over both MS Dhoni & Yuvraj singh (other batsman here) starts strongly while Dhoni again finished off on a high.
We also see sharp dip in Strike rate other batsman (Yuvraj singh), who was dismissed at 48th over while Dhoni continued his assault.

Once again Required run rate starts high at over 6 at final 10 overs, with Dhoni & Yuvraj (the other batsman here) on crease, As seen from graph above Dhoni takes off from the get go & is pure Dhoni show as he powers his side through to a win with some major big hits.

Once again Required run rate starts high at over 6 at final 10 overs, with Dhoni & Yuvraj (the other batsman here) on crease, As seen from graph above Yuvraj is in his element here & tackles the chase head on with SR consistently over 100 throughout while Dhoni shines at the end & finished on high. Another Dhoni & Yuvaraj masterclass in chase with little to split between them but Yuvaraj gets the credit for handling chase brilliantly.

Once again Required run rate starts high at over 6 at final 10 overs, with Dhoni & Suresh Raina (the other batsman here) at crease. Its purely Suresh raina show as he tees off from 43rd over onwards while MS Dhoni maintains a steady SR, although a below par at 70 considering the Required rate, is finally dismissed around 46th over while Raina keeps going on. Full credit to Raina here.

This time is MS Dhoni is joined by Robin Uthappa (the other batsman here), with a high RR Robin uthappa hits the ground running as he quickly tees off at 42nd over & doesnt look back while Dhoni while seems to take his time gets going around 46th over but is dismissed soon after. However Uthappa powers through the chase. Full credit to Uthappa to help his team cross the line.

In this chase MS Dhoni didnt get much to do in final 10 overs, as he maintains a steady SR of 80 is dismissed at 43rd over without tearing into attack. The spike for the other batsman (Rohit sharma here) is shortlived as his quick innings gets cut short 42nd over, followed soon by Dhoni. Not much to write considering we are looking at performance at final 10 under immense chase pressure here. Thnakfully Harbhajan & Raina rounds off a thrilling finish in the end.

Another pure MSD show as he starts on a high & maintains it throughout the final 10 overs as he finished the game in style, with Yuvaraj (the other batsman here) providing a more than a healthy support on the other end with SR of over 80 consistently.

MS Dhoni is joined here by Ravi Jadeja for final 10 overs, as Jadeja does a good effort with a quick start to his innings, though slighly bogged down at 44th over, he quickly recovers to do bulk of scoring. MSD eventually explodes in the final over to get across the line. A game that shouldnt have seen 50th over but with MSD laying low till 47th with a low SR of below 60, but eventually ends on high note. A weird little innings.

Another interesting chase with Dhoni again taking time & laying low despite a high RRR. However, Raina's powerful innings & Ravindra Jadeja's quick runs (both batsmen joined dhoni on other end) sees india home with MSD fireworks stealing show at 50th over. Uncharacteristically slow innings from MS Dhoni on final 10 sees chase go down the wire to 50th over. Again a weird little tactic from Dhoni taking it deep when it could have been avoided.

A thrilling low scoring chase, clearly seen in graph with lower SR of both batsmen here with No 11 Ishant & No 10 Vinay kumar joining MSD on crease. MSD masterfully chases down a low score under pressure playing with tailenders to see India home with a final over flourish. Definitely one of the better, if not best, knock by MSD under pressure while chasing.

MS Dhoni is pretty much reduced to a spectator at the other end as Virat kohli (the other batsman here) bosses the chase with relentless aggression. Although MSD does good job with a SR of 100, Virat kohli is just way too ahead of him & it is his chase.

A high spirited chase where MS Dhoni & Suresh raina (the other batsman here) both do their best to one up each other as they keep up with Required run rate. An equal joint effort sees India home comfortably.

This game sees Manish pandey (the other batsman here) rising up to occassion as he bats on an entirely different pitch & drives india home in a pressure cooker chase scenario. Again we see an uncharacteristic innings from MS Dhoni as he struggles throughout with a low SR despite a high RRR. Thanks to Manish pandey, MSD's tough day with the bat doesnt affect the eventual outcome.

MS Dhoni in final 10 plays second fiddle to Rohit sharma, who hits a fine century & keeps Required run rate in control through out the final 10 overs, with Rohit sharma on song, MSD holds up an end with a healthy SR before being dismissed around 47th over. All Rohit sharma this chase.

MS Dhoni plays second fiddle to Kohli at the start of 40th & then accompanies Dinesh Karthik (other batsman here) as DK hits the ground running with a high RRR. Dhoni again seems to be happy to stay there while allowing others to up the ante, this time DK takes the cake as he proves himself as a finisher this time, allowing MSD to relax.

MS Dhoni again seems to be content to hold on to an end calmly with spiking Required run rate. However, with Kedhar Jadhav declares himself as a finisher as he runs amok while MS Dhoni again plays cautiously while Kedhar jadhav takes risks to get india across line. Seems like MSD is happy to hold on end for last few chases, allowing other batsman lower the order to do some heavy lifting in final 10 overs.

Another chase against australia sees Required run rate creeping up over 6, however this time Kedhar jadhav & MS Dhoni keep up steadily with runrate with Kedhar jadhav hitting his gear at crucial time to get RRR back under control & see home easily. MSD again seems to be playing cautiously in final 10 overs of chase, with boundaries at the tail end of chase sees him finish with a better SR than he maintained throughout.
